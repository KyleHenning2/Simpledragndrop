## Compiling and Using

In the "Drag Drop Preview" folder, open DragDropPreview.html. This file provides a demo using a preview function 
that shows where the item is going to be inserted

In the "Drag Drop Line" folder, open DragDropBasic.html. this file provides a demo using a line that appears where 
the item is going to be inserted and allows dragging via all elements in the item besides the images.

In the "Drag Drop Line" folder, open DragDropHandle.html. this file provides a demo using a line that appears where 
the item is going to be inserted and allows dragging from only the drag handle.
